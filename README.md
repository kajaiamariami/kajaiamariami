# About me <br>
🌷 I'm a 26 years old psychology BA student from Tbilisi, Georgia. <br> 

🦋 My understanding of coding is limited to editing Tumblr themes in 2014-2016. <br>

🧚🏻‍♀️ I decided to learn some basics after I read in one of my psychology textbooks that for researches it's helpful to know Python or R, especially if they work with large data.<br>

🌱 I'm currently learning how to code using DataCamp and Mimo. <br>
